# wake-and-shake
Simple script that runs as a daemon which disconnects than reconnects WIFI when waking up. Requires [Sleepwatcher](https://www.bernhard-baehr.de/) (version 2.2.1 included in this repo) for monitoring sleep/wakeup.

This was created because of constant issues (across different OS versions) with WIFI on my laptop needing to be manually adjusted upon waking
